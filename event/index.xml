&lt;p>In this case, we selected teleseismic receiver functions recorded by a linear seismic array in southeastern Tibet. We used the adjoint method to invert for 3-D Vp, Vs, and density structures. The checkerboard test demonstrates the capability of the receiver function FWI to recover the 3-D structure of the lithosphere.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We further combined the receiver function and ambient noise data to invert for the lithospheric S-wave velocity structure. The joint inversion technique enhances the resolution of the lithospheric structure. We conducted a retrieval test to evaluate the resolution of the RF-FWI, ANAT, and joint FWI. The results show that the joint FWI effectively combines sensitivity of the RF-FWI and ANAT.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="joint-fwi-of-teleseismic-cross-convolution-and-ambient-noise">Joint FWI of Teleseismic Cross-convolution, and Ambient Noise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We further propose a novel objective function for teleseismic FWI based on single and double-difference of cross-convolution. This approach eliminates the need for estimating the source time function during inversion, thus reducing the associated uncertainties. We combine teleseismic cross-convolution, and ambient noise data to invert for lithospheric S-wave velocity structure. We apply the joint inversion technique to investigate Yakutat subduction processes in the southern Alaska, yielding high-resolution lithospheric velocity structures.&lt;/p>
