For example, ambient noise surface wave data has good lateral resolution in shallow depth, while teleseismic waveform and receiver function data have good vertical resolution. By combining multiple data types within the framework of full-waveform inversion (adjoint tomography) and jointly optimizing the velocity model, we can obtain a more reliable and accurate velocity structure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Receiver Function Adjoint Tomography</title><link>https://home.xumijian.me/project/rfat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 10:24:27 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://home.xumijian.me/project/rfat/</guid><description>&lt;p>A new technique for P-wave receiver function (PRF) inversion, within the framework of wave equation-based adjoint tomography and referred to as RFAT, has been developed to obtain models of Vp, Vs, and density. This innovative technique fits the synthetic PRFs with observed PRFs and can better image the lateral variations of Vs from the crust to the uppermost mantle than traditional 1-D PRF inversion. We utilized RFAT to perform high-resolution imaging beneath a dense seismic array in Southeastern Tibet, revealing low-velocity zones (LVZs) extending from the uppermost mantle to the crust, as well as an eastward dipping Moho under the Red River Fault (RRF). Our inversion results provide direct evidence for the existence of a distinct asthenospheric upwelling channel beneath the RRF, and further highlight the effectiveness of RFAT for accurately imaging subsurface structures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seispy: Python Module for Batch Calculation and Postprocessing of Receiver Functions</title><link>https://home.xumijian.me/project/seispy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 22:33:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://home.xumijian.me/project/seispy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Seispy is a graphical interface Python module for receiver function (RF) calculation and post-processing in seismological research. Automated workflows of RF calculations facilitate processing large volumes of different types of seismic data. The graphical user interface enables an intuitive and straightforward evaluation of RF quality. All parameters about the pre-processing for RF estimation can be adjusted based on user preference. Water-level frequency-domain deconvolution and iterative time-domain deconvolution for RF estimation are available in Seispy. The current version of Seispy contains five main modules for the post-processing of RF such as H-k stacking, crustal anisotropic estimation, harmonic decomposition, 2D and 3D Common Conversion Point (CCP) stacking. The CCP stacking in the different application scenarios can be handled by a rich collection of modules, such as time-to-depth conversion, 2D or 3D CCP stacking, and adaptive station or bin selection for CCP stacking profiles in a dense seismic array or a linear seismic array. As a Python module, functions in the Seispy can be called easily in python scripts for other purposes. The modular design allows new functionality to be added in a collaborative development environment. Licensed under GPLv3, Seispy allow users and developers to freely use, change, share and distribute copies of the package.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crustal Structures in the SE Tibet</title><link>https://home.xumijian.me/project/se-tibet-crust/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2019 22:24:27 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://home.xumijian.me/project/se-tibet-crust/</guid><description>&lt;p>The tectonic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau is a focus in the geosciences. Mid‐lower crustal flow is a popular model to interpret the geodynamic mechanism on the margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The model predicts different surface and Moho topographies across the plateau boundary due to the different strengths of the surrounding blocks, i.e., sharp boundaries on the eastern plateau boundary and gentle variations in the southeastern plateau boundary. Here, we employ receiver function and common conversion point stacking analysis with the seismic waveforms recorded by the dense ChinArray and other local seismic stations to accurately define the Moho topography in SE Tibet. We find that the Moho under the Tibetan Plateau is much deeper than that under the surrounding Yangtze Craton and Indochina block; abrupt Moho changes are found across the southeastern plateau margin, similar to that under the eastern plateau margin. We interpret these sharp Moho variations across the plateau margin to have developed when the Tibetan Plateau was extruded southeastward in the late Miocene. Subsequent gravity collapse resulted in crustal extension and gentle topographic variation, while the sharp Moho slope was preserved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mantle Transition Zone Structure in SE Tibet</title><link>https://home.xumijian.me/project/se-tibet-mtz/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2019 21:49:32 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://home.xumijian.me/project/se-tibet-mtz/</guid><description>&lt;p>The subduction of the Indian Plate beneath SE Tibet and its related volcanism in Tengchong are important geologic processes that accompany the evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. However, it is still not clear whether the subduction and volcanism are confined to the upper mantle or if they extend deep into the mantle transition zone (MTZ). Here, we imaged MTZ structures by using receiver function methods with the waveforms recorded by more than 300 temporary stations in SE Tibet. The results show significant depressions of both the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities and a thickened MTZ (260–280 km) beneath SE Tibet. The depression of the 660-km discontinuity (by 10–30 km) and the thickened MTZ correlate well with high P-wave velocity anomalies in the MTZ, indicating the presence of a subducted Indian slab within the MTZ. Significant depression of the 410-km discontinuity (by 10–20 km) beneath the Tengchong volcano indicates that the volcano originates from the MTZ and is closely related to the subducted Indian slab. Our results confirm the deep subduction of the Indian plate and the deep origin of the Tengchong volcano. However, it remains unknown whether a slab gap exists and contributes to the Tengchong volcano.&lt;/p>
