However, it is still not clear whether the subduction and volcanism are confined to the upper mantle or if they extend deep into the mantle transition zone (MTZ). Here, we imaged MTZ structures by using receiver function methods with the waveforms recorded by more than 300 temporary stations in SE Tibet. The results show significant depressions of both the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities and a thickened MTZ (260–280 km) beneath SE Tibet. The depression of the 660-km discontinuity (by 10–30 km) and the thickened MTZ correlate well with high P-wave velocity anomalies in the MTZ, indicating the presence of a subducted Indian slab within the MTZ. Significant depression of the 410-km discontinuity (by 10–20 km) beneath the Tengchong volcano indicates that the volcano originates from the MTZ and is closely related to the subducted Indian slab. Our results confirm the deep subduction of the Indian plate and the deep origin of the Tengchong volcano.

Rise and growth of the Longmenshan are results of the interaction between the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane and the Sichuan Basin. In order to understand the block interactions in the eastern plateau margin, we studied the crustal structures using P wave receiver functions (including H-k staking, CCP stacking, and velocity inversion) with the waveforms recorded by 115 portable stations. The Moho, indicated by clear Ps phases, is generally deeper in the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane than in the Sichuan Basin, while a step is notable under the Longmenshan fault zone. We found a low velocity anomaly in the mid-lower crust below the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane and Longmenshan fault zone, which may imply the accumulated partial melting materials in the deep crust under the eastern plateau margin. Clear P-to-s converted phases are found within the crust of the Sichuan Basin. They look as apparent huge anticline structures, which may be caused by ancient crustal deformation under the stable craton.","tags":["Crustal structures"],"title":"Tectonic evolution of the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau: Insight from crustal structures using P wave receiver functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Mijian Xu**","Zhouchuan Huang","Liangshu Wang","Mingjie Xu","Ning Mi","Dayong Yu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583475873,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583475873,"objectID":"e72641f56a180171df8248f3c80bdbd3","permalink":"https://home.xumijian.me/publication/pepi2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-06T14:24:33+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pepi2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The Indian plate began to subduct under the Eurasian plate in the late Mesozoic. Since the Eocene, continuous continental collision has resulted in the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau with extensive volcanic activity. Geophysical and geochemical studies have suggested that the Indian plate was subducted and that volcanism originated in the deep upper mantle. However, the depth range of the subduction and volcanism and the relationship between them are still unclear. Here, to image the mantle transition zone (MTZ) structures, we deployed new seismic stations and collected as much seismic data as possible from the Tibetan Plateau. We then calculated the receiver functions and analyzed them using the common conversion point stacking method. We found that the MTZ is thickened by ~20 km under the Lhasa block, where high-velocity anomalies are obvious in the MTZ. Apparent thinning of the MTZ by ~20 km was revealed under the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganze blocks, confirming a component of depleted mid-oceanic ridge basalt in the magmatic rocks. Our results suggest that the Indian Plate has at least subducted to the MTZ, which has further induced mantle upwelling and volcanism in the Tibetan Plateau.","tags":["Mantle transion zone"],"title":"Lateral variation of the mantle transition zone beneath the Tibetan Plateau: Insight into thermal processes during Indian–Asian collision","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We add new modules for receiver function (RF) analysis in SplitLab toolbox, which includes the manual RF analysis module, automatic RF analysis and related quality control modules, and H-k stacking module.

In this study we determined high-resolution P-wave seismic images in the upper mantle and transition zone in SE Tibet by jointly inverting the travel-time residuals of local events and the relative travel-time residuals of teleseismic events recorded by very dense seismic stations. We revealed a high- velocity body in the upper mantle beneath South China that represents the root of the Yangtze Craton. The high-velocity body extends in the entire Yangtze Craton at 300–450 km depths, but it is constrained just beneath the Sichuan Basin and surrounded by extensive low-velocity zones to the southwest at 65–250 km depths. We propose that the Yangtze Craton is destructed laterally by the mantle flow extruded from the Tibetan Plateau. We obtain a low-velocity column in the upper mantle under the Tengchong volcano as well as the visible high-velocity bodies in the upper mantle and transition zone below the low-velocity column. The images suggest that the Tengchong volcano is closely related to the subduction of the Burma plate and caused by the dehydration of the subducted slab. The present study reveals unprecedented details of the mantle structures beneath SE Tibet and provides new insights into the geodynamics of the Tibetan Plateau and its interaction with the stable Yangtze Craton.","tags":[],"title":"Mantle structure and dynamics beneath SE Tibet revealed by new seismic images","type":"publication"}]
