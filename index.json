Seismic anisotropy provides important clues for the deformation mechanism. Here we applied the harmonic decomposition approach and further conducted a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) inversion to analyze the crustal anisotropy from receiver functions using waveforms recorded by dense stations in the SE Tibetan plateau. More spatial details on the crustal anisotropy and interface are determined consequently. While the anisotropies in the upper crust are relatively weak (~2%), the anisotropies in the mid-lower crust are mostly stronger than 4%. The fast polarization directions (FPDs) in the mid-lower crust show a dominant circular pattern, in good coherence with the topographic contours, indicating that the crustal deformations in the SE Tibetan plateau may be mainly controlled by the gravity potential. Because of the significant Moho steps along the plateau margin, the extruded deep crustal materials are blocked by the strong crust around so that the minerals are aligned to be sub-parallel to the plateau margins.","tags":["Crustal structures","Crustal anisotropy"],"title":"Layered crustal anisotropy and deformation in the SE Tibetan plateau revealed by Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo inversion of receiver functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mijian Xu","Zhouchuan Huang","Liangshu Wang","Mingjie Xu","Yueqiao Zhang","Ning Mi","Dayong Yu","Xiaohui Yuan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587438895,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587438895,"objectID":"77be45294040a6af95ddc9653da49692","permalink":"https://home.xumijian.me/publication/jgr2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-21T11:14:55+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jgr2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The tectonic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau is a focus in the geosciences.

The Moho, indicated by clear Ps phases, is generally deeper in the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane than in the Sichuan Basin, while a step is notable under the Longmenshan fault zone. We found a low velocity anomaly in the mid-lower crust below the Songpan-Ganzi Terrane and Longmenshan fault zone, which may imply the accumulated partial melting materials in the deep crust under the eastern plateau margin.

Since the Eocene, continuous continental collision has resulted in the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau with extensive volcanic activity. Geophysical and geochemical studies have suggested that the Indian plate was subducted and that volcanism originated in the deep upper mantle. However, the depth range of the subduction and volcanism and the relationship between them are still unclear. Here, to image the mantle transition zone (MTZ) structures, we deployed new seismic stations and collected as much seismic data as possible from the Tibetan Plateau. We then calculated the receiver functions and analyzed them using the common conversion point stacking method. We found that the MTZ is thickened by ~20 km under the Lhasa block, where high-velocity anomalies are obvious in the MTZ. Apparent thinning of the MTZ by ~20 km was revealed under the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganze blocks, confirming a component of depleted mid-oceanic ridge basalt in the magmatic rocks. Our results suggest that the Indian Plate has at least subducted to the MTZ, which has further induced mantle upwelling and volcanism in the Tibetan Plateau.","tags":["Mantle transition zone"],"title":"Lateral variation of the mantle transition zone beneath the Tibetan Plateau: Insight into thermal processes during Indian–Asian collision","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We add new modules for receiver function (RF) analysis in SplitLab toolbox, which includes the manual RF analysis module, automatic RF analysis and related quality control modules, and H-k stacking module.

In this study we determined high-resolution P-wave seismic images in the upper mantle and transition zone in SE Tibet by jointly inverting the travel-time residuals of local events and the relative travel-time residuals of teleseismic events recorded by very dense seismic stations. We revealed a high- velocity body in the upper mantle beneath South China that represents the root of the Yangtze Craton. The high-velocity body extends in the entire Yangtze Craton at 300–450 km depths, but it is constrained just beneath the Sichuan Basin and surrounded by extensive low-velocity zones to the southwest at 65–250 km depths. We propose that the Yangtze Craton is destructed laterally by the mantle flow extruded from the Tibetan Plateau. We obtain a low-velocity column in the upper mantle under the Tengchong volcano as well as the visible high-velocity bodies in the upper mantle and transition zone below the low-velocity column. The images suggest that the Tengchong volcano is closely related to the subduction of the Burma plate and caused by the dehydration of the subducted slab. The present study reveals unprecedented details of the mantle structures beneath SE Tibet and provides new insights into the geodynamics of the Tibetan Plateau and its interaction with the stable Yangtze Craton.","tags":[],"title":"Mantle structure and dynamics beneath SE Tibet revealed by new seismic images","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://home.xumijian.me/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
