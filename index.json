We use receiver function to investigate the MTZ structure beneath the Mongolia Plateau using earthquakes recorded by 223 stations deployed in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The topographies of the 410 km (D410) and 660 km (D660) discontinuities are both characterized by slight depressions in most parts of the Mongolia Plateau. An obvious low-velocity layer (LVL) atop the MTZ with an average thickness of ∼40 km is observed beneath this study area, indicating the hydrous partial molten layer atop the D410 and a hydrous MTZ. The D410 depth of ∼410 km and the LVL up to ∼60 km thick beneath the Dariganga volcano imply that there is a chemically distinct hydrous upwelling related to the subducted Pacific slab rather than a classic thermal-dominated upwelling. The ∼10 km thinned MTZs are found beneath the western Hangay Dome and the Middle Gobi volcano. A narrow NS-trending MTZ thickening zone extending from the Hovsgol rift to the central Hangay Dome is mainly caused by a ∼10 km depression of D660. We speculate that the mantle upwelling beneath the Hangay Dome may be related to the stagnant slab descending through the MTZ, rather than being rooted from the deep lower mantle. Hydrous melting-driven upwellings from the MTZ beneath the Mongolia Plateau play a key role in intraplate volcanism.","tags":[],"title":"Hydrous melting driven upwelling from the mantle transition zone in the Mongolia Plateau revealed by receiver function analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuzhi Hu","Mijian Xu","Mingjie Xu","Yueqiao Zhang","Zhouchuan Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665123873,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665123873,"objectID":"425b17df659f2154bb305de441eda171","permalink":"https://home.xumijian.me/publication/pepi2022/","publishdate":"2022-10-07T14:24:33+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pepi2022/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate the crustal structure and Moho topography beneath the northwest Ordos rift zone by employing receiver functions analysis at dense broadband seismic stations.

In this study, we delineate the Moho geometry in southern California by jointly using local Moho-reflected waves PmP and teleseismic Moho-converted waves Ps.

We have also extracted 38,648 high-quality P-wave receiver functions (RFs). The Moho depth is initially estimated via the common conversion point (CCP) stacking of RFs and then refined by inverting the PmP travel time data in a community velocity model (CVM-H, version 15.1.1). The newly built Moho geometry is generally consistent with the California Moho Model version 1.0 (CMM-1.0), that is, a shallow Moho beneath the Salton Trough (23 km), a uniformly shallow Moho beneath the Mojave Desert and the Basin and Range (34 km). However, our Moho model reveals some new features different from the CMM–1.0, such as a deep Moho (∼34 km) beneath the northern end of the central and western Transverse Ranges, consistent with the observation of deep seismicities due to a thick brittle crust there. We also find a gradual transition from the lower crust to the uppermost mantle beneath the western Peninsular Ranges, leading to the rareness of pickable PmP waves as well as weak Moho-converted signals there.","tags":[],"title":"Moho Complexity in Southern California Revealed by Local PmP and Teleseismic Ps Waves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mijian Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":162864e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":162864e4,"objectID":"a8edef490afe42206247b6ac05657af0","permalink":"https://home.xumijian.me/talk/seispy-python-module-for-batch-calculation-and-post-processing-of-receiver-functions/","publishdate":"2021-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/seispy-python-module-for-batch-calculation-and-post-processing-of-receiver-functions/","section":"event","summary":"A tutorial of Seispy in chinese invited by [Prof. Huajian Yao](http://yaolab.ustc.edu.cn/).","tags":[],"title":"Seispy: Python module for batch calculation and post-processing of receiver functions","type":"event"},{"authors":["Cunrui Han","Mijian Xu","Zhouchuan Huang","Liangshu Wang","Mingjie Xu","Ning Mi","Dayong Yu","Tao Gou","Haibo Wang","Shijie Hao","Muyu Tian","Yajing Bi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590560673,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590560673,"objectID":"65a78ae0bce31b3842af81d287593f05","permalink":"https://home.xumijian.me/publication/pepi2020b/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T14:24:33+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pepi2020b/","section":"publication","summary":"The southeastern (SE) Tibetan plateau is uplifting accompanying strong seismicity, but the relationship between the crustal structure and tectonic process in this region is still unclear.

More spatial details on the crustal anisotropy and interface are determined consequently. While the anisotropies in the upper crust are relatively weak (~2%), the anisotropies in the mid-lower crust are mostly stronger than 4%. The fast polarization directions (FPDs) in the mid-lower crust show a dominant circular pattern, in good coherence with the topographic contours, indicating that the crustal deformations in the SE Tibetan plateau may be mainly controlled by the gravity potential.

However, the depth range of the subduction and volcanism and the relationship between them are still unclear. Here, to image the mantle transition zone (MTZ) structures, we deployed new seismic stations and collected as much seismic data as possible from the Tibetan Plateau. We then calculated the receiver functions and analyzed them using the common conversion point stacking method. We found that the MTZ is thickened by ~20 km under the Lhasa block, where high-velocity anomalies are obvious in the MTZ. Apparent thinning of the MTZ by ~20 km was revealed under the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganze blocks, confirming a component of depleted mid-oceanic ridge basalt in the magmatic rocks.

In this study we determined high-resolution P-wave seismic images in the upper mantle and transition zone in SE Tibet by jointly inverting the travel-time residuals of local events and the relative travel-time residuals of teleseismic events recorded by very dense seismic stations. We revealed a high- velocity body in the upper mantle beneath South China that represents the root of the Yangtze Craton. The high-velocity body extends in the entire Yangtze Craton at 300–450 km depths, but it is constrained just beneath the Sichuan Basin and surrounded by extensive low-velocity zones to the southwest at 65–250 km depths. We propose that the Yangtze Craton is destructed laterally by the mantle flow extruded from the Tibetan Plateau. We obtain a low-velocity column in the upper mantle under the Tengchong volcano as well as the visible high-velocity bodies in the upper mantle and transition zone below the low-velocity column. The images suggest that the Tengchong volcano is closely related to the subduction of the Burma plate and caused by the dehydration of the subducted slab. The present study reveals unprecedented details of the mantle structures beneath SE Tibet and provides new insights into the geodynamics of the Tibetan Plateau and its interaction with the stable Yangtze Craton.","tags":[],"title":"Mantle structure and dynamics beneath SE Tibet revealed by new seismic images","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://home.xumijian.me/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
