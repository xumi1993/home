abstract = {We investigate the crustal structure and Moho topography beneath the northwest Ordos rift zone by employing receiver functions analysis at dense broadband seismic stations. The results delineate a depressed Moho zone (by ∼5 km) beneath the Cenozoic rifts, which is unconventional for classical continental rift zones. We interpret this depressed Moho zone as a relict of the thickened crustal root formed during the intracontinental orogeny in late Mesozoic. The Cenozoic rift has not yet reequilibrated the crustal-mantle boundary possibly due to the lack of decompressional melting during the lithospheric extension.}
